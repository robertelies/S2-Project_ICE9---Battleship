As explained in the readme file, the database that this project uses is 
provided through the remoteMySql.com service. This is an online database, 
becuase of the nature of this service, it does not require you to create 
any tables, however sometimes there are connectivity issues where the service
has time out issues. This can be solved by restarting the intellij project and 
building the project once again.

If opening the datagrip project doesnt show the session initialised,
please use the information below to log into the online database:

URL: jdbc:mysql://remotemysql.com:3306/rOpEOsqC8q
Database: rOpEOsqC8q

User: rOpEOsqC8q
